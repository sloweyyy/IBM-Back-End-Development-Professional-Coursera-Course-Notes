# Course Notes: Software Architecture Patterns and Deployment Topologies

## Overview

This material provides an in-depth look at various software architecture patterns, including component-based architectures, service-oriented architecture (SOA), and distributed systems. It also covers different architectural patterns and deployment topologies essential for designing scalable and maintainable software systems.

### Component-Based Architectures

-   **Definition**: Components are individual units of encapsulated functionality that serve as part of an application.
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of an application or in different applications.
    -   **Replaceability**: Components can be replaced with minimal impact on the rest of the system.
    -   **Independence**: Components operate independently of one another.
    -   **Extensibility**: Components can be extended to include new functionality.
    -   **Encapsulation**: Internal details of components are hidden from other components.
    -   **Non-Context Specific**: Components are designed to function in various contexts.
-   **Examples**: APIs, database interfaces, controllers.
-   **Design Approach**: Component-based architecture decomposes the design into logical components, offering a higher level of abstraction compared to object-oriented designs.

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

-   **Definition**: SOA involves creating services that are designed to be deployed independently and reused by multiple systems.
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   **Business-Focused**: Services are designed to solve specific business needs.
    -   **Loosely Coupled**: Services interact via a communication protocol over a network, minimizing dependencies between them.
    -   **Components and Objects**: Services are composed of components, which in turn consist of objects.
-   **Use Case**: Ideal for enterprises that require integration of diverse applications across different platforms.

### Distributed Systems

-   **Definition**: Distributed systems consist of multiple services located on different machines, coordinating interactions by passing messages.
-   **Characteristics**:
    -   **Single System Appearance**: The system appears as a coherent whole to the end-user.
    -   **Resource Sharing**: Resources like databases and servers are shared across the system.
    -   **Fault Tolerance**: The system continues to operate even if one or more components fail.
    -   **Concurrency**: Supports multiple processes running simultaneously.
    -   **Scalability**: Can scale out by adding more nodes or services.
-   **Node**: A device on a network that can recognize, process, and transmit data.
-   **Architectural Types**:
    -   **Client-Server**: A server provides resources or services, and clients access them.
    -   **Three-Tier**: Consists of presentation, application, and data tiers.
    -   **Peer-to-Peer**: Nodes act as both clients and servers.
    -   **Microservices**: Breaks down applications into small, modular services that operate independently.

### Architectural Patterns

-   **2-Tier (Client-Server)**: Involves a server hosting resources and services delivered to the client.
-   **3-Tier**: Most common architecture consisting of presentation, middle, and data tiers.
-   **Peer-to-Peer**: A decentralized network where nodes act as both clients and servers.
-   **Event-Driven**: Focuses on producers and consumers of events.
-   **Microservices**: Breaks down applications into modular components, each handling a specific function.

### Application Deployment Environments

-   **Application Environments**: Consists of the hardware and software resources required to run an application, including code, software stack, OS, networking components, and hardware.
-   **Pre-Production Environments**:
    -   **Development**: Where the application is actively coded.
    -   **QA (Quality Assurance)**: For testing the application.
    -   **Staging**: Mimics the production environment closely.
-   **Production Environment**: The final environment where the application is deployed for all users, considering load, security, reliability, and scalability.

### Deployment Options

-   **On-Premises Deployment**: The system and infrastructure are located within the organizationâ€™s physical location.
-   **Cloud Deployment Models**:
    -   **Public Cloud**: Hosted by third-party providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.
    -   **Private Cloud**: Offers increased security and flexibility, hosted on private servers.
    -   **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines the benefits of both public and private clouds.

### Production Deployment Components

-   **Firewalls**: Security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
-   **Load Balancers**: Distribute network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed.
-   **Web Servers**: Serve content like web pages, files, and media to clients.
-   **Application Servers**: Run business logic and provide applications to clients, handling tasks like data creation, storage, and retrieval.
-   **Proxy Servers**: Intermediaries that handle requests between clients and servers, often used for load balancing, caching, and enhancing security.
-   **Database Servers**: Manage databases, allowing data storage, retrieval, and management by applications.

This material introduces application development tools that can help developers throughout the process of creating and deploying cloud applications. The main tools discussed are version control, libraries, and frameworks.

Version control systems are used to track changes made to source code, allowing developers to revert to older versions if needed. Git and GitHub are popular version control systems.

Libraries are collections of code that can be used within an application, saving time and effort by providing pre-built functionality. Examples of libraries include jQuery for JavaScript and Apache Commons Proper for Java.

Frameworks provide a standardized way to build and deploy applications. They act as a scaffold for developers to add their own code and determine the program flow. Examples of frameworks include AngularJS, Vue.js, and Django.

Frameworks have a predefined workflow and provide less flexibility compared to libraries, but they offer standardization and efficiency. They often include their own libraries.

Overall, these tools are essential for developers to streamline their development process and create efficient and standardized applications.

In this section, we will explore various tools that can help you in the application development process. These tools include CI/CD, Build Tools, Packages, and Package Managers. Let's break down each tool and its purpose:

Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):

CI/CD refers to the practices of continuous integration and either continuous delivery or continuous deployment.
CI ensures that all code components work together smoothly by integrating newly developed code frequently.
CD deploys all code changes in a build to a testing or staging environment.
Build Tools:

Build tools transform your source code into the binaries needed for installation.
They organize your source code, set compile flags, and manage dependencies.
Build automation is crucial in environments with multiple interconnected projects and developers.
Packages:

Packages are archive files that contain the necessary files, installation instructions, and metadata for an app.
They simplify the installation process for users by bundling all the required files together.
Package Managers:
Package managers are tools that help distribute and manage software packages.
They handle tasks such as finding, installing, maintaining, or uninstalling software packages.
Package managers also manage dependencies to ensure all required packages are installed.
By utilizing these tools, you can streamline your development process, ensure code reliability, and simplify the deployment of your applications.

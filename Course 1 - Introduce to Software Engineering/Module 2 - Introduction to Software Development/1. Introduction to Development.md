# Course notes: Introduction to Development

## Overview of Web and Cloud Development

-   **Basics of Web Construction**: Understanding how websites are constructed and delivered, including client-server communication.
-   **Development Types**:
    -   **Front-end Development**: Focus on what users interact with directly in their web browsers.
    -   **Back-end Development**: Involves server-side logic, databases, and application programming interfaces (APIs).
    -   **Full-stack Development**: Combines both front-end and back-end development skills.
-   **Tools**: Importance of using appropriate tools such as code editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

-   **Phases**:
    -   Planning
    -   Design
    -   Development
    -   Testing
    -   Deployment
    -   Maintenance

## Basics of Programming

-   **Programming Languages**: Exploring different programming languages used in software development.
-   **Frameworks**: Understanding frameworks used in front-end development (e.g., Angular, React, Vue).

## Software Architecture and Design

-   **Design Principles**: Architectural patterns and best practices for designing software systems.

## Job Opportunities in Software Engineering

-   **Career Paths**: Various roles and career opportunities in software engineering.

## Front-end Development

-   **Languages and Frameworks**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue.

## Back-end Development

-   **Importance**: Creating and managing resources to respond to user requests in web or cloud applications.
-   **Tasks**: User account management, authentication and authorization, data processing and storage, ensuring security.
-   **Languages and Frameworks**: JavaScript, Python, Node.js, Express, Django, Flask.
-   **Databases**: Working with databases and using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools.

## Teamwork in Software Development

-   **Importance**: Effective communication, collaboration, and support among team members.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Diverse perspectives for better problem-solving and decision-making.
    -   Larger scope and risk-taking capabilities.
    -   Enhanced experience and support system.
-   **Collaboration**: Working with various stakeholders like UX designers, product managers, and business analysts.

## Pair Programming

-   **Concept**: An Agile development technique where two developers work together at one computer.
-   **Styles**:
    -   **Driver/Navigator Style**: One developer types (driver), while the other reviews and gives directions (navigator).
    -   **Ping-pong Style**: Incorporates test-driven development, with developers taking turns writing tests and implementing code.
    -   **Strong Style**: Junior developers learn from more experienced developers.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   Knowledge and skill sharing.
    -   Building soft skills.
    -   Improving code quality.
    -   Early error and bug detection.
    -   Real-time code reviews.
-   **Challenges**:
    -   Requires long periods of focus and coordination.
    -   Scheduling conflicts due to personal or work commitments.
    -   Potential personality clashes.
    -   Risk of one person taking over and hindering learning.

## Experiences with Pair Programming

-   **Benefits**:
    -   Learning from more experienced engineers.
    -   Gaining expertise in specific programming languages or environments.
    -   Real-time feedback and brainstorming.
    -   Eliminating the wait for code reviews.
-   **Challenges**:
    -   Potential for one person to dominate.
    -   Frustration from different problem-solving approaches.
    -   Need for dedicated time and aligned schedules.
-   **Outcome**: Despite challenges, pair programming can result in better code, increased efficiency, and improved collaboration.

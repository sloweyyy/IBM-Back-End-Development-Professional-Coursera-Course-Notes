# Course Notes: Programming Logic and Concepts

## Overview

This material covers fundamental concepts in programming, focusing on programming logic, variables, branching, looping, identifiers, containers, functions, and objects. Understanding these concepts is crucial for writing efficient, effective, and modular programs.

### Programming Logic: Branching and Looping

#### Branching Logic

-   **Definition**: Branching logic is used to make decisions and determine the path a program takes based on certain conditions.
-   **Components**:
    -   **Boolean Expressions**: Evaluate to either `true` or `false`, guiding the program's decision-making process.
    -   **Variables**: Hold values that can change depending on conditions or information passed to the program.
-   **Constructs**:
    -   **If Statements**: Executes a block of code if the condition is `true`.
    -   **If-Then-Else Statements**: Provides an alternative block of code if the condition is `false`.
    -   **Switch Statements**: Selects one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of a variable.
    -   **GoTo Statements**: Directs the program flow to another part of the code (less common in modern programming).

#### Looping Logic

-   **Definition**: Looping logic involves repeating a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met.
-   **Basic Loop Statements**:
    -   **While Loop**: Continues to execute as long as the condition is `true`.
    -   **For Loop**: Executes a set number of times, often used when the number of iterations is known.
    -   **Do-While Loop**: Similar to a `while` loop but guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once.

### Programming Concepts: Identifiers, Variables, and Containers

#### Identifiers

-   **Definition**: Names given to various programming elements such as variables, constants, functions, and objects.
-   **Types**:
    -   **Constants**: Values that do not change throughout the program.
    -   **Variables**: Storage locations that hold data which can be changed during program execution.

#### Containers

-   **Definition**: Structures used to store and manipulate multiple elements in a program.
-   **Examples**:
    -   **Arrays**: Fixed-size containers that store elements of the same data type.
    -   **Vectors**: Dynamic-size containers (often used in languages like C++) that can grow or shrink in size.

### Functions and Objects

#### Functions

-   **Definition**: Modular components of a program that perform specific tasks and can be reused throughout the code.
-   **Types**:
    -   **Standard Library Functions**: Predefined functions provided by the programming language.
    -   **User-Defined Functions**: Custom functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks.
-   **Usage**:
    -   **Defining a Function**: Creating the function and specifying what it does.
    -   **Calling a Function**: Invoking the function to perform its task.

#### Objects

-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: A programming methodology focused on objects, which are instances of classes.
-   **Components**:
    -   **Properties (Fields)**: Variables that hold the object's state.
    -   **Methods**: Functions that define the object's behavior.
-   **Analogy**: Objects can be compared to real-world entities, like a user account or a database table, which have properties and behaviors.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   **Modularity**: Allows code to be organized into self-contained units.
    -   **Reusability**: Objects can be reused across different parts of the program or in different programs.

### Conclusion

This material provides a comprehensive understanding of key programming logic and concepts, including branching and looping logic, identifiers, variables, containers, functions, and objects. Mastery of these concepts is essential for developing efficient, modular, and maintainable code in any programming language.

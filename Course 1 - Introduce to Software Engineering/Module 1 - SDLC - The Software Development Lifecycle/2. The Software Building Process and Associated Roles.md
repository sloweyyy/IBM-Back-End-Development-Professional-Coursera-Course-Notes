## Software Development Methodologies

In this course on Software Development Methodologies, you will learn about different approaches to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and compare their pros and cons. The three main methodologies discussed are Waterfall, V-shape model, and Agile.

### Waterfall Method:

-   **Description**: A sequential approach to software development where each phase is completed before moving on to the next. Planning and requirements are defined upfront.
-   **Customer Feedback**: Limited until the testing phase.
-   **Pros**: Easy to understand and follow, clear roles for team members, easier budget estimation.
-   **Cons**: Lack of flexibility, difficult to incorporate changes, long intervals between releases.

### V-shape Model:

-   **Description**: Similar to Waterfall, but with a verification and validation process. Phases form the shape of a V, with corresponding verification and validation phases.
-   **Pros**: Simple and easy to use, saves time in test planning, clear structure.
-   **Cons**: Difficult to accommodate changing requirements, hard to change functionality during the testing phase.

### Agile Method:

-   **Description**: A collaborative and iterative approach to development focusing on short cycles or sprints, usually one to four weeks long. Unit testing is done in each sprint to minimize risk.
-   **Customer Feedback**: Encouraged at the end of each sprint.
-   **Pros**: Allows for changing requirements, handles complications easily, encourages customer collaboration.
-   **Cons**: Challenging upfront planning, resource allocation can be difficult, overall scope may not be clearly defined.

**Summary**: Agile is the most popular method used in modern software development due to its flexibility and ability to adapt to changing requirements. However, each methodology has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's important to choose the right approach based on the project's needs and constraints.

## Software Versions

In this course on Software Versions, you will learn about the importance of software versioning and how it helps developers keep track of changes, updates, and patches to their software.

### Key Topics:

-   **Software Version Numbering**: Understanding the semantic numbering system.
-   **Compatibility Issues**: How to identify and troubleshoot compatibility issues between old and new software versions.

**Summary**: By the end of the course, you will have a clear understanding of software versioning and its significance in the software development process.

## Software Testing

Software testing integrates quality checks throughout the software development cycle to ensure error-free software that meets expected requirements.

### Types of Testing:

1. **Functional Testing**: Verifies system inputs and outputs to ensure they meet functional requirements.
2. **Non-functional Testing**: Checks attributes like performance, security, scalability, and availability.
3. **Regression Testing**: Confirms that recent changes, such as bug fixes, do not adversely affect existing functionality.

### Testing Levels:

1. **Unit Testing**: Verifies specific sections of code.
2. **Integration Testing**: Identifies errors when combining smaller code modules.
3. **System Testing**: Evaluates the complete integrated system.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Verifies the system's compliance with user needs and requirements.

**Summary**: Test cases are written to verify the functionality of a software application and ensure requirements have been satisfied.

## Software Documentation

In this course on Software Documentation, you will learn about different formats of documentation, the distinction between product and process documentation, the categories and types of documentation, and the purpose of standard operating procedures (SOPs).

### Documentation Formats:

-   **Formats**: Written, video, or graphical assets associated with a software product's development and use.
-   **Phases**: Applicable across all phases of the SDLC.

### Product Documentation vs. Process Documentation:

-   **Product Documentation**: Relates to the functionality of the software product.
-   **Process Documentation**: Describes how to complete a task and provides requirements for quality implementation of a business process.

### Categories and Types of Documentation:

1. **Requirements Documentation**: Describes the expected features and functionality of the software system.
2. **Design Documentation**: Explains how the software will be built to meet the requirements.
3. **Technical Documentation**: Includes comments in the code and documents engineers' ideas and thoughts during project implementation.
4. **Quality Assurance Documentation**: Pertains to a testing team's strategy, progress, and metrics.

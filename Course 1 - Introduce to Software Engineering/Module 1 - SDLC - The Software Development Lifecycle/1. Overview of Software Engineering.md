## Key Concepts

### Software Engineering

-   **Definition**: The process of using programming languages and engineering principles to build software products.
-   **Roles**: Includes front end, back end, security, mobile, test, full stack, DevOps, cloud data, and machine learning engineers.
-   **Lifecycle**: Involves designing, implementing, supporting, and maintaining software.
-   **Titles**: Software engineer and developer are often used interchangeably, though software engineering may encompass the entire development lifecycle.

### Evolution of Software Engineering

-   **Software Crisis**: Refers to the challenges and complexities faced in software development, leading to the need for systematic approaches.
-   **Systematic Approach**: Adoption of structured methods to improve software quality and development efficiency.

### Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

-   **Definition**: A systematic process for developing high-quality software within predictable timeframes and budgets.
-   **Phases**: Planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
-   **Benefits**: Minimizes risks and costs, ensures software meets client requirements, improves efficiency, increases communication, defines responsibilities, and accommodates changing requirements.

### Phases of SDLC

1. **Planning Phase**

    - Activities: Requirements gathering, analysis, documentation, and prioritization.
    - Considerations: Users, purpose, data inputs and outputs, compliance, risk, resources, and scheduling.
    - Output: Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

2. **Design Phase**

    - Activities: Development of software architecture based on SRS, collaboration, stakeholder review, and feedback.
    - Output: Design Document used by developers.

3. **Development Phase**

    - Activities: Coding based on the Design Document, task assignment, use of programming tools, languages, and software stacks.
    - Standards: Organizations may have coding standards or guidelines.

4. **Testing Phase**

    - Activities: Thorough testing for stability, security, and requirement compliance.
    - Methods: Manual, automated, or a combination.
    - Levels: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

5. **Deployment Phase**

    - Activities: Releasing the application into the production environment.
    - Stages: User acceptance testing (UAT) before full production release.

6. **Maintenance Phase**
    - Activities: Collecting feedback, identifying UI issues and additional requirements, suggesting code enhancements, and fixing bugs.
    - Approach: Iterative process allowing for continuous improvements.

### High-Quality Software Traits

-   Software that meets client requirements, is stable, secure, efficient, and maintainable.

### Building Quality Software

#### Overview

-   **Objective**: Learn about the common software engineering processes required for building high-quality software.
-   **Key Processes**: Requirements gathering, design, coding for quality, testing, releases, and documenting.

#### Processes in Detail

1. **Requirements Gathering**

    - **Definition**: Collecting and documenting the set of requirements that the software needs to adhere to.
    - **Types**: Functional requirements, external and User Interface (UI) requirements, system features, and non-functional requirements.

2. **Design**

    - **Definition**: Transforming the requirements into a structure that developers can use.
    - **Activities**: Breaking down requirements into related components with clearly defined behaviors, boundaries, and interactions.
    - **Considerations**: System functions, performance, security, and platform characteristics.

3. **Coding for Quality**

    - **Definition**: Writing code that fulfills the intended requirements of the software without defects.
    - **Activities**: Following coding standards, conventions, patterns, and styles, using automated tools to detect errors, and commenting in the code for better understanding and modification.

4. **Testing**

    - **Definition**: Verifying that the software matches the established requirements and is free of bugs.
    - **Objectives**: Ensure reliability, security, performance, and efficiency.
    - **Levels**: Unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.

5. **Releases**

    - **Definition**: Distribution of the software to different audiences.
    - **Types**: Alpha release (first functioning version for select stakeholders), beta release (version for stakeholders outside the developing organization), and general availability (GA) release (for all users).

6. **Documenting**
    - **Definition**: Providing documentation to both technical and non-technical users.
    - **Types**:
        - **System Documentation**: For technical users, explaining how the software operates.
        - **User Documentation**: For non-technical end-users, assisting them in using the product.

### Requirement Gathering in Software Engineering

#### Steps in Requirement Gathering

1. **Identifying Stakeholders**: Determine who will be affected by the project.
2. **Establishing Goals and Objectives**: Define what the project aims to achieve.
3. **Eliciting Requirements**: Gather requirements through interviews, surveys, and observation.
4. **Documenting Requirements**: Record the gathered requirements.
5. **Analyzing and Confirming Requirements**: Ensure the requirements are clear, complete, and feasible.
6. **Prioritizing Requirements**: Determine the importance and urgency of each requirement.

#### Important Documents

-   **User Requirement Specification (URS)**: Documents the business needs and expectations of the end-users.
-   **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**: Captures the functionalities and performance benchmarks of the software.
-   **System Requirement Specification (SysRS)**: Outlines the requirements of the entire system, including system capabilities, interfaces, and acceptance criteria.

## Conclusion

By understanding and applying these software engineering processes, you will be able to build high-quality software that meets the requirements and expectations of users. This includes a thorough understanding of the SDLC, building quality software, and effective requirement gathering.
